Optional cheats/tweaks offered in loader
- infinite health
- teleport (press "T", type in X/Y coords when prompted to teleport there)

Conservative "physics" tweaks
- maybe allow jumping to be terminated by letting go of Shift?
- some way of preventing player getting stuck (or, if that's not possible, escaping from being stuck)

Optimise performance
- avoid slowdown in some circumstances
- perhaps improve responsiveness
- more consistent frame rate, perhaps with a "wait for next frame" delay if we haven't overrun
- on a BBC B standing still in first room, each sun/moon visible step takes 67-68cs as human and 69-70cs a gargoyle (not sure why there's a difference) -  a moon cycle takes 75.1s, a sun cycle takes 72.4s - there are 1133 "game loop cycles" in both a sun and a moon cycle, and there are 11 game cycles per visible sun/moon step, so 103 visible steps per sun/moon cycle - 75.1/103=0.73, 72.4/103=0.70, which is fairly close to what I measured before - the difference probably being accounted for by the time taken for the sun/moon transition effect - so if say 70cs per game cycle, waiting (if we've not already missed it, as we probably would *now*) for a 35th TV frame before continuing round the game loop would give us a steady game that should feel smoother but "similar" to the original code.

Maybe play the background music under interrupts so it's consistent?

Maybe tweak the random colours for each room
- e.g. maybe disallow a few "really intense" combinations (like white+{yellow,cyan} for the two colours used in the walls)
- maybe disallow yellow+white or white+cyan both being in the palette at the same time?!
- maybe have some static per-room colours instead of them being completely random (e.g. taken from Ed's map)
- maybe remember the random colours for each room the first time you enter it, so that within a single game the colours are consistent??

Maybe use interrupts to allow different colours (fixed? or just "differently random to the room") in the header/footer regions

Produce a single version that works on BBC and Electron
- worth bearing this in mind in general, as some tweaks (e.g. interrupts to allow different colours) would not play nice with Electron compatibility (but we could in principle build two variants and put them on the same disc, rather than having nearly all common code)

Ideally the game will work if put on tape (probably easy, and not that important, but would be nice)

Pixel-perfect collision detection when enemies drain health?
- it may already *be* pixel perfect, I haven't checked
- probably must not do this *if* the collision detection affects physics rather than health drain

MODE 2 version using 16K of sideways RAM?
- perhaps also with a NuLA version?

Perhaps remove the energy drain when you touch the objects you have to collect?

Actually remove the prisms from the room when you collect them?
Show the prisms somewhere on the screen after you've collected them, so you know how many you have? (wihtout an explicit "n/4" as it's maybe a little spoilery - nothing in the instructions says "4 prisms")

Don't do two separate "jump_time%=jump_time%+1" in PROCjump - inefficient

Would it break anything visually if world-2.bas were tweaked so the player sprite always occupies the same slot? If this is visually indistinguishable, making this change would potentially simplify the game code a lot, saving space and probably speeding things up (for a start, the player OS coordinates could probably just live permanently in the relevant sprite slot variables, if they're not used by any "competing" sprite slots which share those variables)

Fix the "phantom wall-eater" glitch

Would there be any point in an "item randomiser" which positions the prisms at random (but in a definitely winnable) locations to add replay value?
