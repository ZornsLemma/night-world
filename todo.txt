Optional cheats/tweaks offered in loader
- infinite health
- teleport (press "T", type in X/Y coords when prompted to teleport there)
- the current "yes/no" series of questions isn't too bad, but might be nicer to have a screen showing the options with a key you can press to toggle them independently, then press e.g. SPACE to go ahead and load the game

Conservative "physics" tweaks
- maybe allow jumping to be terminated by letting go of Shift?
- some way of preventing player getting stuck (or, if that's not possible, escaping from being stuck)

Optimise performance
- avoid slowdown in some circumstances
- perhaps improve responsiveness
- more consistent frame rate, perhaps with a "wait for next frame" delay if we haven't overrun
- on a BBC B standing still in first room, each sun/moon visible step takes 67-68cs as human and 69-70cs a gargoyle (not sure why there's a difference) -  a moon cycle takes 75.1s, a sun cycle takes 72.4s - there are 1133 "game loop cycles" in both a sun and a moon cycle, and there are 11 game cycles per visible sun/moon step, so 103 visible steps per sun/moon cycle - 75.1/103=0.73, 72.4/103=0.70, which is fairly close to what I measured before - the difference probably being accounted for by the time taken for the sun/moon transition effect - so if say 70cs per game cycle, waiting (if we've not already missed it, as we probably would *now*) for a 35th TV frame before continuing round the game loop would give us a steady game that should feel smoother but "similar" to the original code.

Maybe play the background music under interrupts so it's consistent?

Allow option to play with sound effects but no background music?

Allow sound to be toggled on/off during play, not just at the start of the game?

Maybe tweak the random colours for each room
- e.g. maybe disallow a few "really intense" combinations (like white+{yellow,cyan} for the two colours used in the walls)
- maybe disallow yellow+white or white+cyan both being in the palette at the same time?!
- maybe have some static per-room colours instead of them being completely random (e.g. taken from Ed's map)
- maybe remember the random colours for each room the first time you enter it, so that within a single game the colours are consistent??
- maybe use a split palette effect to colour the lower half of room A differently
- maybe colour room A differently once you've passed through the secret passage (probably *not* if we can use a split palette effect in first place)

Maybe use interrupts to allow different colours (fixed? or just "differently random to the room") in the header/footer regions

Produce a single version that works on BBC and Electron
- worth bearing this in mind in general, as some tweaks (e.g. interrupts to allow different colours) would not play nice with Electron compatibility (but we could in principle build two variants and put them on the same disc, rather than having nearly all common code)

Ideally the game will work if put on tape (probably easy, and not that important, but would be nice)

Pixel-perfect collision detection when enemies drain health?
- it may already *be* pixel perfect, I haven't checked
- probably must not do this *if* the collision detection affects physics rather than health drain

MODE 2 version using 16K of sideways RAM?
- perhaps also with a NuLA version?

Perhaps remove the energy drain when you touch the objects you have to collect?

Show health regeneration/fleece at bottom of screen once collected, as we do with prisms?

Tweak prism display
- Ed has a suggestion but I don't know what it is yet
- Lum 2022-06-29 post on stardot has suggestions

Don't do two separate "jump_time%=jump_time%+1" in PROCjump - inefficient

Fix the "phantom wall-eater" glitch - probably done

Would there be any point in an "item randomiser" which positions the prisms at random (but in a definitely winnable) locations to add replay value?

Fixes related to passage to 4th prism sealing off/collecting health before 4th prism/needing health before you can collect the fleece
- obviously be very careful here, what the author's intentions were and what's just a bug isn't all that clear - just making a note here so this isn't forgotten accidentally

Try to avoid the risk of being bitten by DFS 2.26 corrupting memory below &1900: https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=12195

Replace all the delays and keypresses at end of game with a utility routine that:
- ensures no key is currently pressed (flushing buffer is probably not good enough in practice, based on what I've observed at times)
- waits until you press a key
This way you will never miss a message and can take as long as you want to observe your score etc.

Should the "fixed high contrast colours" be applied during the loading screens as well?

There is an intermittent freeze - probably fixed in 0.16.

Should there be a speed option (e.g. 6 vs 7 centiseconds per game cycle)? It would be nice to just "get it right" but it may not be possible.

"Chimneys" where shaving off a row of pixels (or one on either side) might avoid getting stuck - probably ask experienced players for feedback on these, it may be I am just too incompetent to escape without any tweaks:
- vertical stack of single blocks at left of room K

Maybe do the relocation down to &E00 from machine code? Using the technique of poking TOP directly in zp (and perhaps PAGE, if doing from machine code) discussed e.g. here https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=25768&p=374428#p374428 might help.
