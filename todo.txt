Optional cheats/tweaks offered in loader
- infinite health
- teleport (press "T", type in X/Y coords when prompted to teleport there)

Conservative "physics" tweaks
- maybe allow jumping to be terminated by letting go of Shift?
- some way of preventing player getting stuck (or, if that's not possible, escaping from being stuck)

Optimise performance
- avoid slowdown in some circumstances
- perhaps improve responsiveness
- more consistent frame rate, perhaps with a "wait for next frame" delay if we haven't overrun

Maybe play the background music under interrupts so it's consistent?

Maybe tweak the random colours for each room
- e.g. maybe disallow a few "really intense" combinations (like white+{yellow,cyan} for the two colours used in the walls)
- maybe have some static per-room colours instead of them being completely random (e.g. taken from Ed's map)

Maybe use interrupts to allow different colours (fixed? or just "differently random to the room") in the header/footer regions

Produce a single version that works on BBC and Electron

Ideally the game will work if put on tape (probably easy, and not that important, but would be nice)

Pixel-perfect collision detection when enemies drain health?
- it may already *be* pixel perfect, I haven't checked
- probably must not do this *if* the collision detection affects physics rather than health drain

MODE 2 version using 16K of sideways RAM?
- perhaps also with a NuLA version?

Perhaps remove the energy drain when you touch the objects you have to collect?
