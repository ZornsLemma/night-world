Notionally A%-P% inclusive are used by sprite package
- are some actually free to be used safely?
Sprite package also uses W%, X%, Y% and Z% at times
Also Q%, R%, S%, T%, U%, V%
So naively we only have P% free!

world-2.bas uses:
A% B% C% D% E% F% G% H% I% J% K% L% M% N% Q% S% T% U% V% W% X% Y% Z%
does not use:
O% P% (except one-off assembly) R%

V% isn't used much and world-2 could do something like foo=V% on startup and replace CALL V% with CALL foo without it hurting anything

So we maybe kinda-sorta have O% P% R% V% free (and don't forget it's possible if the "wrong" W% values are used, O% and P% may be read/written by the sprite code)

TBH we could probably get away with shifting all of the sprite library subroutines out of ri variables into ordinary ones. The CALL itself is a pretty negligible performance impact I should think.

So we might have (assuming O% and P% really can be used safely):
O% P% Q% R% S% T% U% V%
- no, we can't use O% and P%, because W%=8 is used with CALL T%, which uses the corresponding ri variables O% and P% to communicate with the internal machine code call to S%

So we have Q% R% S% T% U% and V%, with very minor and fairly safe tweaks. (Don't forget we'd need to make the CALLV% in the main code not update these variables, or save them before and restore them after.)
- we might want/need to reserve at least one of these for returning values to callers of any additional subroutines we add.


Candidates
lee_x_os% Q%
lee_y_os% R%
m% - "IFA%=2:" seems to be ~14.5% faster than "IFa%=2:" (condition false all the time) in some tests on BASIC 2 - wrapping the m% increment-and-wrap-and-test and initial bit of PROCm up in machine code might well pay off too

Moon/sun cycles taking approx: 7512 7246 7516 7245 cs with untweaked code
7629 7357 7633 with code tweaked to get rid of Q%-V% for subroutines - looks like a small perf hit!
7296 7021 7298 with lee_[xy]_os% put into Q%/R% - so looks like we're net ahead
6832 6557 6836 with score%=100 RND() short-circuited
6785 6512 6790 with m%->S% - not as impressive as I'd hoped, but a small win
6791 6516 6796 short-circuiting line 291's POINT() tests - but starting point probably does match the first POINT() and I'm not moving in these tests - if I manually move left to stand with both feet on floor I get 6326 6602 6335 so there is quite a win sometimes, and it doesn't really seem to *hurt*
6705 6433 6708 cr%->T% modest improvement
6673 6400 6677 day_night%->U% very small win
6610 6343 6615 falling_time%->V% very small win
